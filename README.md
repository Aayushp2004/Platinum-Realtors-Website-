latinum Realtors — Real Estate Service Website
A modern UI website built for a real estate business, featuring Leave & License services and Property Sale/Purchase functionalities.

This project demonstrates my ability to design and develop a fully responsive, animated, and professional multi-page website using React, Vite, TailwindCSS and Framer Motion.
The website was created as part of a real freelance project for Platinum Realtors, a real-estate service provider.
